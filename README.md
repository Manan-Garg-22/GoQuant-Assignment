This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
Created a Next.js crypto orderbook project fulfilling the criteria for GoQuant Frontend Application. The project displays a real-time orderbook for the BTC-USD trading pair, with 10 levels of best bids and asks, updating at regular intervals. It features a live Spread Indicator graph, an Orderbook Imbalance Indicator, and a Market Depth Chart, all of which update with each orderbook change. The application is fully responsive, ensuring compatibility across various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops. Additional features include color-coding for significant changes and the ability to switch between different trading pairs.
## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install chart.js chartjs-chart-financial chartjs-adapter-date-fns axios next-themes react-spring react-just-parallax tailwindcss
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
